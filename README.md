# Creative Survival
A Minecraft server plugin that balance Creative mode in a Survival Multiplayer Serverfor - fork of LimitCreative Reloaded

Items spawned in creative will be given a lore stating that it was spawned in creative. You can then enable/disable config options to change if survival players can use these items. This is a great way for tracking down who has been spawning in items, and preventing them from giving out usable diamonds etc...

They are unable to attack with them, wear the armor, craft with them, shoot and place the spawned in items. Only creative mode users can do this.

Any blocks marked as creative spawned, will not be usable with pistons. This is due to a weird Minecraft bug where piston events fire more than once sometimes, which can cause bugs.
